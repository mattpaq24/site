                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p class="sub">Beyond considering the needs of plan creators, I felt that understanding the needs of
                    plan
                    consumers
                    (university students) should inform the structure of the PCT. This way, I could design the PCT so
                    that
                    plan
                    creators can more easily create plans that align with consumer needs.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>I talked to students and advisors from three private
                universities in Nova Scotia, and two public universities in California.</p>
            <p>I conducted one-on-one interviews, and led a focus group consisting of peer leaders at one of the schools
                in
                Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p>Following these interviews, I conducted a literature review to ensure that my findings from these
                schools would apply to other univerisities.</p>

            <table class="research-table">

            <p>In addition to creating traditional user journey maps, I created a plan journey map. I felt this more
                accurately reflected the fact that creator needs are inherently informed by consumer needs.</p>

                <h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>
                <p class="sub">Inspired by Alan Cooper's <i>About Face</i>, I assembled a list of the data and
                    functional needs of both creators and consumers and listed relevant input and output methods.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Consumer Needs</h3>
            <p>I referred to interview notes and browsed some university websites to determine the data objects
                required by students.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Creator Needs</h3>
            <p>To define creator needs, I broke down the information architecture of courses provided by Khan Academy
                and Coursera. This helped me create three distinct functional groups:</p>
            <p><strong>Plan info</strong></p>
            <p>Describes the plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Plan structure</strong></p>
            <p>The overall structure and organization of steps.</p>
            <p><strong>Writing steps</strong></p>
            <p>The individual steps that make up a plan.</p>

                <h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
                <p class="sub">I made a series of sketches, then brought these to management and the dev team to decide
                    on a single, technically feasible version.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Sketching functional views</h3>
            <p>I sketched a few variations of each functional group, then organized these groups into user flows.
                <img class="needs-background" src="Images/lo fi.svg" alt="Sample of Initial Ideation">
            <h3>Making Decisions</h3>
            <p>I discussed technical feasibility with our dev team – it was decided that they would handle the entirety
                of rich
                text input for authoring steps.</p>
            <p>After bringing these to my CEO and PM and doing some hallway testing, we decided on an eventual flow to
                build upon.
                We further agreed that steps should be built to only allow for text
                content due to time and budget constraints.</p>

                <h2>Refinement</h2>
                <p class="sub">After deciding on a single flow, I looked to make a high fidelity version to pass off to
                    the dev team.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Considering Constraints</h3>
            <p>While it had been decided to leave step creation as a text-only process, I felt that the use of
                constraints would help plan creators make plans that work for consumers.</p>
            <p>I made some more hi fi sketches of flows in which plan creators are constrained to one action
                per step. I felt that constraining each step in this manner would decrease cognitive overload,
                compared to if creators were to be given free reign over steps.</p>
            <p>This particular iteration demonstrates a more templatized version of step creation.</p>

            <h3>Making Cards</h3>
            <p>I personally feel this was the weakest part of this project. I had spent too much time thinking about the
                system and had little time to make hi fi wireframes due to the deadline imposed by an upcoming
                conference.</p>

                <h2>Post Development</h2>
                <p class="sub">After the PCT had been built, the company ceased development efforts to save money. I
                    felt that the inclusion of data objects (contact info, calendar events, etc.) would greatly increase
                    the quality of
                    plans, and looked for ways to add them to action plans using existing infrastructure.</p>
            </div>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>While looking through the company's web API, I found that the text fields that contain step content could
                read html tags. While this
                functionality could not be accessed from the mobile app, I was able to add cards for that allowed users
                to:
            <ul>
                <li>Open webpages in iFrames</li>
                <li>View an address in the user's default map application.</li>
                <li>Open the user's default email app to send emails to a specific recipient.</li>
                <li>Call a phone number.</li>
                <li>Add events to a user's Google Calendar</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>While app users wouldn't be able to access these, I was able to make some custom plans for a university
                admin
                I previously interviewed.</p>

                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <p class="sub">The PCT was my first major design project, and was built without the guidance of a more
                    experienced designer. While I'm glad I had the opportunity to build a new feature from scratch and
                    bring it all the way to development, there are many things I wish I had done differently.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Improving Visual Design</h3>
            <p>My visual design was entirely too novel. As I feel that visual design is the weakest link in my UX
                toolkit, I've been looking to Google Material and Apple's Interface Guidelines to learn more about
                industry trends and general tips to improve the look and feel of my future designs.</p>
            <h3>Improving Time Management</h3>
            <p>I spent entirely too much time conducting research and nailing down the data and functional requirements
                of users, which left little room for sketching and visual design. Since this was
                my first time building myself a sprint from scratch, I feel more confident that I will be able to speed
                up
                this process in the future.</p>
            <h3>Usability Improvements</h3>
            <p>While I didn't conduct formal testing, I was able to gain feedback by showing my designs to a few
                friends.</p>
            <p>If we had the budget to make edits to the PCT, I would have made the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make initialization one item at a time (Title, Description, Category) instead of all on a single
                    screen.</li>
                <li>Including more feedback — adding some indicator that a step was succesfully created.</li>
                <li>Informing the user about the moderation process before submitting a plan.</li>
